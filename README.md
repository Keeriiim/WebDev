# Lifecycle
The request lifecycle starts with the user browsing to example.com.  The browser contacts a DNS server to resolve the domain name (example.com) to an IP address. The browser sends an HTTP request to the server at the resolved IP address. The server processes the request and sends back an HTTP response containing the following resources:
- HTML: The structure and content of the web page.
- CSS: Styles and layout instructions for the HTML content.
- JavaScript: Scripts that add interactivity and functionality to the web page.
- Images: Visual content like photos and graphics.
- Other Resources: Additional resources such as fonts, videos, or data files (e.g., JSON)
